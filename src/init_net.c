/* 'create_network' array must adhere to the following rules:

     'num_input' determines the number of inputs that net receives.
 *   2) Only one net can serve as the final output (-1) of the network.
 *   3) To specify that a net receives inputs from other nets: 
 *   	  In the 'output' of each net that sends inputs, you must indicate the index of the receiving net.
 *	  The receiving net must set its 'num_input' to the sum of the lasts layers of the source nets.
